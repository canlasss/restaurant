                With two No. 1 albums on the Billboard World chart and seven hit singles, it isn’t hard understand why BLACKPINK is one of the most popular girl groups 
                in the world. But how were BLACKPINK’s members discovered? Lisa, Jennie, Rosé and Jisoo have been in the band since it debuted with “Boombayah” in 2016, but what were their lives like before BLACKPINK and how did they become trainees for YG Entertainment? Well, like most K-pop bands, BLACKPINK’s road to success is complicated.             
                BLACKPINK, formed by YG Entertainment (one of the “Big 3” entertainment companies in K-pop), debuted in August 2016 with their first single “Boombayah.” 
                <br/>
                Since then, the four-member girl group has achieved international success. The band, which has sold millions of records worldwide, became the first K-pop 
                act to perform at Coachella in April 2019. 
                <br/>
                The girl group also has a song, titled “Kiss and Make Up,” with Grammy winner Dua Lipa, and has caught the attention of celebrities like Harry Styles 
                (who attended one of their concerts in April) and Ariana Grande. 
                <br/>
                So, yes, if you haven’t heard of BLACKPINK by now, it’s time to catch up. And what a better way to start than learning how the band’s four 
                members—Lisa, Jennie, Rosé and Jisoo—became a part of BLACKPINK in the first place.
